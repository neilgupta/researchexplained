title: Is COVID-19 spread through airborne transmission and surfaces?
description: Pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are detectable after breathing, using the toilet, and touching surfaces, but this study did not recover any infectious virus particles nor provide evidence of human-to-human spread of COVID-19 through small airborne particles or surfaces.

      <h3 class="timeline-title">Collected surface and air samples from rooms and personal items of COVID-19+ patients</h3>
      {% include expand_details.html positive_count=1 warning_count=3 %}

        <p>
          Researchers sampled surfaces of common personal items like cell phones, common room areas like tabletops, and toilets. They also sampled hard to reach areas like ventilation grates and underneath beds. They also sampled air from rooms and hallways of COVID-19+ patients and also from devices worn by COVID19- facility workers maintaining social distance.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Reasonable sampling methods</h5>
        <p>
          Researchers sampled a wide range of air spaces and surfaces.
        </p>

        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Not real world scenarios</h5>
        <p>
          All of these patients were symptomatic, knew their diagnosis, and were living in a hospital. This might not reflect real world scenarios, like asymptomatic carriers, or presymptomatic patients in early stages. Real world cases might be more or less infectious than these patients.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Lack of details and consistency about the samples</h5>
        <p>
          The samples were not consistent and uniform. For example during the sampling of the air inside the patients rooms, some patients removed their masks, and others did not feel comfortable and did not remove their masks, meaning we don’t know how wearing a mask might affect air contamination.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} There was a delay between diagnosis and sampling</h5>
        <p>
          All of the samples were collected at least 5 days after diagnosis and most after 10 days. If people are most infectious early in the disease, this study would miss that.

      <div class="collapsible">
        <p>
          Researchers first used a test called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to look for the virus. This test works by looking for parts of the virus' genetic material (RNA). PCR only tells us if the virus’ genetic code is present, not if it is infectious.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Lack of negative controls</h5>
        <p>
          Negative controls are very important. It can help scientists rule out contaminations or other complications with their tests or samples. The researchers could have shown that their tests were sound by examining samples from patients who did not have COVID-19, but they did not do this.

          Growing virus in the lab requires infecting cells with the virus. These kinds of experiments are challenging to do correctly. The researchers were not able to grow any virus samples.
        </p>

        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} The culture data is inconclusive</h5>
        <p>
          One way to test if your lab experiment is correctly growing the virus is to use a positive control which is a sample that you know contains living virus. For example, researchers can take a mucus sample from the lungs of a COVID-19 patient. Assuming the experiment is working correctly, the virus should infect cells in the lab and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the researchers did not test their equipment and methodology by using a positive control, we do not know if the samples were actually not infectious or if they simply did not grow because the experiment was done incorrectly.

        <p>
          The researchers found genetic material from the virus in places that would not be reached by large droplets, suggesting that the virus particles can be spread via airborne transmission. They also found the virus on most of the surfaces that the patients had interacted with. But, those samples were unable to infect cells in a laboratory setting. As noted above, it's possible the virus was no longer functioning or "living", or this simply could be an issue with the experiment.

        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Limited support for conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          Whether COVID-19 can be spread through the airborne route (tiny droplets that hang in the air for a long time) or from touching contaminated surfaces is still unknown. While they clearly found pieces of the virus in the air and on surfaces, none of their samples were able to infect cells in a laboratory setting, so we cannot conclude that surfaces containing virus particles are a major source of infection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that follow-up studies can help clarify this important issue.
