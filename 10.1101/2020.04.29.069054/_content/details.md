## Key takeaways

* Spike D614G became the dominant form of SARS-CoV-2 during March 2020.
* Spike D614G may have made the virus more contagious, but it's also possible that Spike D614G became more common due to random chance. For example, it may have arisen from a [founder effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect) in the European population that later spread to other parts of the world.
* In clinical data from more than 400 patients, the new D614G form was not statistically significantly more contagious or lethal than the prior form.
* Further studies are needed to determine the exact role of Spike D614G in the transmissibility and lethality of SARS-CoV-2.

## Why is this important?

Headlines in early May 2020 touted claims of a new SARS-CoV-2 strain (Spike D614G) that is more contagious and possibly more deadly. In addition to potentially worsening the pandemic, a new mutation could potentially impact efforts to develop vaccines or drugs against the virus.

### What is Spike D614G?

The protein in the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that is responsible for recognizing and entering human cells in the lung is called the spike protein. This protein is composed of 1,276 amino acids, and is the target for almost every vaccine currently in development.

Amino acid 'aspartic acid' <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF8E7">(D)</span> was found at position <span class="highlight">614</span> in the initial sequences obtained for this virus. This study, however, has shown that in many of the sequences from more recent patients, amino acid 'glycine' <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF6F6">(G)</span> can be found in this position. Therefore, the mutation is called <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF8E7">D</span><span class="highlight">614</span><span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF6F6">G</span>, meaning amino acid <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF8E7">D</span> at position <span class="highlight">614</span> was mutated to <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF6F6">G</span>. There are now two main forms of the virus: the initial form with amino acid <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF8E7">D</span> in position <span class="highlight">614</span> (<span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF8E7">D</span><span class="highlight">614</span>), and the new mutated form with amino acid <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF6F6">G</span> at this position (<span class="highlight" style="background-color: #FEF6F6">G</span><span class="highlight">614</span>).
