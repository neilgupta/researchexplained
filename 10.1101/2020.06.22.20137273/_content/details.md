## Key takeaways

* In this [randomized control trial](https://researchexplained.neil.gg/edu/randomized-control-trial), a cheap and common corticosteroid `(dexamethasone)` reduced mortality and time spent in the hospital for patients who needed help breathing - either with supplemental oxygen or with a ventilator.
* Dexamethasone does not appear to help patients who donâ€™t require oxygen or a ventilator, and may actually cause harm for these patients.
* These results indicate that use of corticosteroids should be considered for patients who have more severe symptoms from COVID-19.

## Why is this important?

COVID-19 can have very high mortality rates for patients who have been hospitalized, and there are not many good treatments for patients who are doing poorly. In England, rates of mortality are as high as 37% in patients who need a ventilator to help them breathe. As a result, doctors have been looking at multiple possible treatments, including ones that have been seen in the news: vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and other medications. Among the treatments that have been tested in clinical trials, so far only remdesivir has demonstrated a reduction in the time for recovery, and it is not clear whether it reduces mortality from COVID-19. Even if remdesivir is an effective treatment, it remains fairly expensive and may not be widely available for all patients.

This particular study suggests that use of a commonly available corticosteroid, dexamethasone, may help to significantly reduce the risk of death or deterioration in the hospital, and improve the rate of recovery.
