title: How common are mutations in SARS-CoV-2, and do the mutations lead to changes in the severity of the disease?
description: A small study convincingly shows that coronavirus may have more mutations than previously expected, but more data is needed on whether these mutations actually change how deadly the virus is.

      <div class="collapsible">
        <p>The 11 patients came into the researchers' hospital in China in January 2020, and were confirmed to have coronavirus. The researchers found that they were able to isolate functioning viral particles from poop üí©</p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>
          ‚úÖ Functioning viruses in poop is an exciting finding
        </h5>
        <p>
          Finding active coronavirus in poop is a new finding that should be further investigated, as it may affect how people protect themselves from contracting the virus.
        </p>
        <h5>
          ‚ö†Ô∏è Lack of standardization in virus sampling
        </h5>
        <p>
          A challenge in virus research is making sure you have the same amount of live virus in each sample because this can make a huge difference in the results.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="cursive"><strong>Example:</strong></span> Let's say a sample has 100 virus particules, but only 20 of them are <abbr class="hint--bottom hint--medium" aria-label="Whether viruses are actually living things is a biological debate, but in this context, we just mean the virus particles are able to reproduce or replicate.">living</abbr>, meaning they can actually reproduce.</p>
          <p>
            {% for i in (1..100) %}
            <span style="margin-left: 3px; color: {% if i <= 20 %}#00a2a4{% else %}#ccc{% endif %};">~</span>
            {% endfor %}
          </p>
          <p class="caption">Sample A</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, another sample has only 50 virus particles, but all 50 of them are living.
          </p>
          <p>
            {% for i in (1..50) %}
            <span style="margin-left: 3px; color: #00a2a4;">~</span>
            {% endfor %}
          </p>
          <p class="caption">Sample B</p>
          <p>
            Standardizing between both samples before you start measuring how quickly they kill cells is super important because you could mistakenly conclude that sample B is more deadly when really it just started with more living virus particles.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          There are techniques for balancing these differences out, but the researchers don‚Äôt provide any detail on whether or how they did this.
        </p>
        <h5>
          ‚ö†Ô∏è Only one sample per patient
        </h5>
        <p>
          Growing the virus can vary a lot from sample to sample so generally researchers try to take multiple samples from the same patient or samples from multiple patients who have similar strains of the virus to make this process more reliable. In this study, the researchers only took a single sample from each patient, and every patient had a different strain of the virus.

          This was a two part study. In the first part, they isolated coronavirus from these patients and determined if they had any mutations in their genome using deep sequencing.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>
          ‚úÖ Excellent deep sequencing techniques
        </h5>
        <p>
          The researchers have excellent evidence to show how much the virus mutates. The genetic sequencing technique they used was more sensitive and of higher quality than prior studies, which allowed them to pick up more mutations.

          In the second stage, they grew the different strains of virus in the lab and measured how rapidly the strains could reproduce in (and subsequently kill) cells growing in a dish.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>
          ‚ö†Ô∏è Samples grown in monkey cells, not humans
        </h5>
        <p>
          The cells that the authors used in the study were monkey kidney cells, which are commonly used in studies of viruses, and specifically for coronaviruses like SARS and the current coronavirus. It‚Äôs always challenging to know if these findings would apply in living humans.

        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <p>The authors have not demonstrated that the mutations that they detected actually changes how sick humans get. The data on how quickly the virus reproduces and how deadly it is needs much more testing and verification to see if this is true outside of a petri dish. We wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock in this finding just yet.</p>
        <h5>
          ‚ö†Ô∏è Small sample size
        </h5>
        <p>
          Since they only took samples from 11 patients who were all very different (their ages alone ranged from 4 months to 62 years), it is impossible to say if the mutations are why some were sicker than others. This would require a lot of data and further study.
