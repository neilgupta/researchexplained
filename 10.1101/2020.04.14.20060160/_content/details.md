## Key takeaways

* Though this study only used samples from 11 patients, it was well designed and used super deep sequencing technique to show that the coronavirus has more mutations than previously thought.
* The data on how quickly the virus reproduces and how deadly it is needs much more testing and verification to see if this is true outside of a petri dish. We wouldn't put too much stock in this finding just yet.
* Finding live virus in patient's stool is a new finding that merits further investigation

## Why is this important?

This research is important for a couple reasons. Figuring out what mutations there are and how quickly the coronavirus mutates is important for researchers working on treatments and vaccines so that they can target the right areas of the virus. Second, if different strains of the virus are more infectious or more lethal than others, this could help different countries and regions better manage their outbreaks.

This study has recently been taken up by media outlets, mainly focusing on the possibility that mutations might make some strains of the coronavirus more deadly than others. Let's take a look at those claims.
