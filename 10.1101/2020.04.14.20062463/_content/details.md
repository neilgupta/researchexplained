## Key takeaways

1. This updated version of the study makes more reasonable claims than the first, and their estimate of 1.3-4.7% seems in line with other studies that have come out. These findings should not be extrapolated to other parts of the country like New York.
2. There are still concerns about how participants were selected and the accuracy of the test used, and the researchers acknowledge this uncertainty. 
3. Figuring out what percentage of the population has had COVID-19 remains vitally important, and there are many ongoing studies both in California and across the world that will help answer this question.

## Why is this question important?

The question is important for two reasons:

1. We don't really know how many people have been exposed to the coronavirus. Due to a shortage of tests, many people with symptoms or suspected cases of coronavirus have not been tested, so the number of positive coronavirus tests probably underestimates the number of people who have had the virus. This can help decision makers understand how many people have the virus, which helps them make decisions about controlling its spread.
2. How dangerous is coronavirus? This reason is related to the first. Since we don't know how many people are infected, we can't accurately calculate how common it is to suffer serious symptoms or die from the virus. This is really important for us to understand so that we can understand the risks of the virus and also try and prepare our hospitals for the number of people who might need medical help.

Getting more information about these areas would be helpful for public health experts, epidemiologists, hospitals, and political leaders to implement the correct actions to control the pandemic.

## Our take

The [first version](/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463/v1) of the study had come under heavy criticism from other researchers based on the way they tested for antibodies and the statistical techniques they used to arrive at their final estimate, so let's take a look at the strengths and weaknesses of the updated version.

### Strengths

This was an ambitious study that was among the first of its kind in the United States. It provides a template for future researchers to improve upon. In the updated version of the study, the researchers acknowledged more of the flaws and limitations to their findings. Their estimated percentage (1.3-4.7%) of the population that has had COVID-19 seems more in-line with their data and the results of other studies in LA, New York, and other locations. 

### Weaknesses

A full discussion of the study and its analysis could fill a book chapter. We discuss three main areas of concern below.
