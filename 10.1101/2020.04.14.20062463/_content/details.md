## Key Takeaways

* This study was a first step in demonstrating the use of antibody tests but more population studies will need to be done moving forward to confirm or refute the findings. These findings cannot be applied to other parts of the country like New York.
* At this time, we really don't know if the population the researchers tested was representative enough to draw firm conclusions about how many people have had the virus or what the death rate is.
* There was a lot of excitement generated in the news and social media over only half of the story. We caution against reading too much into these headlines without examining the details.

## Why is this question important?

The question is important for two reasons:

1. We don't really know how many people have been exposed to the coronavirus. Due to a shortage of tests, many people with symptoms or suspected cases of coronavirus have not been tested, so the number of positive coronavirus tests probably underestimates the number of people who have had the virus. This can help decision makers understand how many people have the virus, which helps them make decisions about controlling its spread.
2. How dangerous is coronavirus? This reason is related to the first. Since we don't know how many people are infected, we can't accurately calculate how common it is to suffer serious symptoms or die from the virus. This is really important for us to understand so that we can understand the risks of the virus and also try and prepare our hospitals for the number of people who might need medical help.


Getting more information about these areas would be helpful for public health experts, epidemiologists, hospitals, and political leaders to implement the correct actions to control the pandemic.

## Our Take

This study has come under heavy criticism from other researchers based on the techniques used to arrive at their conclusions, so let's take a look at the strengths and weaknesses of the research.

### Strengths

This was an ambitious study that was among the first of its kind in the United States. It provides a template for future researchers to improve upon. The researchers attempted to control for some of the limitations in their testing and acknowledged some of the limits on the conclusions that can be drawn from their study.

### Weaknesses

There are several areas pointed out by other researchers that limit how sure we can be about the results in this study. We discuss these below.
