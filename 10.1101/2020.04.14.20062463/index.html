title: What percent of Santa Clara County, California has been infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19?
description: In this updated version, more modest claims from the researchers put the estimated rate at between 1.3-4.7%, which seems in line with other studies, though there are still ongoing concerns about the methods.

        <p>
         Participants found out about the study through targeted Facebook ads. However the demographics (sex, race, zip code) were not very representative of the county as a whole. For example, only 8% of participants were Hispanic while the county is actually 26% Hispanic. The other problem is that certain people in the community, like the elderly who don't have internet access or can't easily drive to a testing center, were less likely to participate. Even more worrisome is that the ad to sign up for the study was circulated by a relative of the supervising researcher to a parents group in a wealthy zip code which could have further skewed the data. <span id="fnr:1" class="fn"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></span>

          While most coronavirus tests look for the virus in the nose or throat, in this study, participants drove to a drive-through collection site where they had blood drawn through a finger prick. The blood was analyzed for antibodies which are produced when the body fights off a viral infection. By looking for these antibodies in your blood, it can be determined if you had the virus or not, even if you never showed any symptoms.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>
          {% include neg.html %} Antibody blood test may not be accurate enough
        </h5>
        <p>
          No test is perfect, and every test will have some rate of false positives and false negatives. False positives are where the test says that a person has antibodies, but they actually do not. False negatives are where the test says the person doesn't have antibodies, but they actually do. In the updated study, the authors provide new data that shows the antibody test they used was even more accurate than they previously reported. This would go a long way to answering one of the concerns we expressed in our review of the <a href="/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463/v1">first version</a>. Still our concerns about the accuracy of the test remain, as much of the new data was provided by the manufacturer, and the test is currently unapproved and banned for export by the Chinese CDC. <span id="fnr:2" class="fn"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></span>

          The researchers used a number of statistical techniques to extrapolate their results to the population of the entire county. Based on this number, the authors made the claim that the actual number of infections in the county was much higher (26-95 times) than had been reported from standard testing. If true, that means COVID-19 is not as deadly as we thought, since a lot more people have it than we realized.
