## Key Takeaways

1. Hydroxychloroquine -- typically used as an anti-malarial/immune suppressant medication -- is unlikely to be the magic pill to cure COVID-19. Based on this one-month study of hospitalized veterans at VA hospitals across the United States, patients given hydroxychloroquine alone actually had a statistically greater risk of death compared to a control group that received just the standard of care. Patients given both hydroxychloroquine AND azithromycin (an antibiotic) did not have a greater risk of death relative to the control group. 
2. Given potential side effects like cardiac toxicity, HCQ should be prescribed with caution.
3. This study has the caveat of being retrospective, which means certain key variables (namely, pre-existing conditions) could not be controlled between groups. Ongoing randomized control trials -- which isolate the effect of the drug via randomizing what treatment patients receive --  will help provide a more definitive answer on this topic.

## Why is this important?

Political leaders, including President Trump, have touted hydroxychloroquine as a promising treatment after [an early French study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32205204) appeared to show impressive results in COVID-19 patients. However, the study has been heavily criticized for not including a control group in its experimental design. Without a control group, we have no way to tell whether patients recovered due to the drug or on their own -- and thus, we have to take the studyâ€™s conclusions with a heavy dose of skepticism.

Despite the flawed evidence, people have started treating themselves with hydroxychloroquine or one of its chemical cousins, believing it will protect them from COVID-19. This has led to [at least one instance of death](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820512107/man-dies-woman-hospitalized-after-taking-form-of-chloroquine-to-prevent-covid-19) and a shortage for those who actually need the drug for conditions including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Here, combating rumors with solid evidence could have important medical consequences.

## Our Take

This study presented preliminary but strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine is likely not an effective treatment for COVID-19.
