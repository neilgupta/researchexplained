title: Is a Spike protein mutation making COVID-19 more infectious?
description: Experiments carried out in kidney cells seem to show that the D614G mutation helps stabilize the spike protein, and might be responsible for its increase throughout the globe. These experiments were not carried out in settings similar to an actual COVID infection, and some results contradict previous work on the subject. Therefore, the results should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism.

        <p>
          The researchers tested their hypothesis that the D614G mutant is more transmittable by using a cellular model. As the virus is dangerous and you need special training and equipment to handle it, researchers often use parts of the virus that they want to study and place them in an unrelated virus (usually harmless to humans), which allows them to study the virus while reducing the risk of working with it.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Used two different cellular models</h5>
        <p>
          The first model that the researchers used added the COVID spike protein to a mouse virus that cannot normally infect human cells. They used this modified virus to infect human kidney cells. The protein on lung cells that the spike protein recognizes is not present on those human kidney cells, so those cells also had to be modified to include this protein on their surface. Now, the researchers had a model that they could use. The second cellular model that they used was made up of the COVID virus with important parts missing, which made it no longer risky to humans.
        </p>

        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Models might be too simplistic</h5>
        <p>
          Certain proteases (such as furin and TMPRSS2), which are enzymes that breakdown proteins, have shown to be very important for virus entry and infection may be missing in these models. For example, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.15.042085v1">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/21/11727">peer-reviewed</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276520302641">articles</a> have stated that blocking these proteases leads to much lower virus infectivity. However, one of the controls in this paper is removal of the part of the virus that protease furin can cut, and the researchers showed that not only did the virus not have lower infectivity, but it had a higher level of infectivity. This likely points to the fact that the virus and the infection can behave differently in this simplified lab model as compared to the infection out in the world.

          The researchers then used their model to track the effects of the D614G mutation using a variety of lab-based experiments. As long as we accept the context of these experiments (carried out in simplified model systems), we can judge the validity of the experiments themselves.
        </p>
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Mutation increased rate of infection in lab setting by ~9-fold</h5>
        <p>
          The experiments that were designed and carried out seem to show that the D614G mutation increased how efficiently the virus particles are able to infect human cells expressing the needed protein for the virus to recognize.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} D614G mutation seems to reduce “S1-shedding”</h5>
        <p>
          S1-shedding refers to the first part of the spike protein (the part responsible for binding to the human cell) can fall away. This process seems to be essential for virus entry into human cells, however, it is possible that if this is done at the wrong time, the virus can lose its ability to target the human cells. Think of it like making pasta. You have to drain the water after the pasta is boiled to have a good meal. However, if you drain the water before you put the pasta in it, you will not have a good dish waiting for you. This is similar. While the shedding of the S1 part seems very important for the virus to enter the human cells, this has to happen after the S1 part has performed its duty in attaching the virus to the human cells. It looks like the D614G mutation strengthens the interaction between the 2 parts of the spike protein, and allows it to hold onto this part longer. This could be good or bad (avoids throwing the pasta water before you add the pasta, but might make it harder to drain the pasta after it is cooked).
        </p>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Virus neutralized by antibodies from recovered patients</h5>
        <p>
          This was an area of concern specifically with regards to immunity and vaccine development. There was, at least initially, a concern that the patients who had gotten the original form of the virus may not be protected against the new mutant version (D614G). This paper, along with <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.161323v1">another more recent one</a>, provide evidence that patients who have gotten any form of COVID seem to have neutralizing antibodies that do not distinguish between the two forms of the virus (in the second source, 38/41 patients showed comparable levels of neutralization of infection for either form). The caveat here is that the built up immunity in these cases was due to the patients getting and subsequently recovering from COVID, whereas this can still be an area of concern when developing vaccines against the virus.

      <h3 class="timeline-title">D614G mutation can lead to an increase in infectivity</h3>
      {% include expand_details.html positive_count=2 warning_count=1 %}
      <div class="collapsible">
        <h4>Our Take</h4>
        <p>
          This paper, alongside <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.161323v1">a slightly more recent pre-print</a>, both point towards an evolutionary advantage provided to the COVID virus by the D614G mutation, when tested on a simplified model. Both sets of researchers used a similar model and got very similar results. While the results they got seem valid and scientifically sound, the main question with regards to this work is how much will these results in a simplified model match the course of the infection in real humans. And while both of these works add to our knowledge about this mutation and its possible effects, more broad generalized conclusions should be viewed rather skeptically. It is absolutely possible that this virus can lead to an increased efficiency of infections in the real world, however we cannot base that conclusion solely on these two papers.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Mutation can help two parts of the spike protein interact more strongly</h5>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://www.researchexplained.org/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054/">original study that identified the D614G mutation</a> proposed that this mutation might weaken the interaction between the two parts of the spike protein, and that might lead to an increase in infection efficiency. It is clear from the results from these two new pre-prints that the original proposal is wrong, and that the interaction between the two parts of the spike protein are actually strengthened by this mutation. Based on the strength of the evidence, this conclusion is likely to hold even in the case of the virus during a real human infection.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include pos.html %} Patients who recovered seem to have neutralizing antibodies regardless of this mutation</h5>
        <p>
          Both studies show that antibodies from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID are able to stop the infection in the simplified lab setting for either form of the virus.
        </p>
        <h5>{% include neg.html %} Not enough evidence to conclude that the D614G mutation can lead to an increase in infectivity</h5>
        <p>
          While the researchers provide ample evidence that the D614G mutation can increase the efficiency of infection in a simplified model under lab settings, it is unclear if these results can be translated directly to the case of the virus in the real world.
