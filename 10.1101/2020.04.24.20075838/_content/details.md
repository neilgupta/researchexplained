## Key takeaways

* There was no statistically significant difference in the level of vitamin D in the blood of patients with more severe cases of COVID-19
* This study design could not prove that Vitamin D leads to more severe COVID infection 
* Although there is a higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in African Americans and they have had a disproportionate number of deaths due to COVID-19, there are many other factors such as unequal access to medical care and health disparities that could explain this finding.

## Why is this important?

Vitamin D supplementation is relatively cheap and safe. If low vitamin D levels were related to COVID-19 disease severity, then supplementing with Vitamin D pills would be an easy fix.

They chose to study the relationship between Vitamin D and COVID-19 severity because there is evidence in animals and in cells that Vitamin D is important for regulating the immune system in the lungs. There is some evidence that people with low Vitamin D levels get more lung infections in general. But, having higher Vitamin D levels might just be a marker for overall healthiness, eating better, getting more sunlight, or many other confounding factors unrelated to lung health. From the data, itâ€™s not clear if we should be giving people Vitamin D supplements to protect their lungs. There is some evidence that giving vitamin D prior to some types of surgery <span id="fnr:1" class="fn"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></span> or to people with low vitamin D levels can protect the lungs <span id="fnr:2" class="fn"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></span>; there is also a large study showing that giving a large dose of vitamin D to critically ill people does not improve their chance of survival <span id="fnr:3" class="fn"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></span>.
