## Why is this important?

There has been significant public interest in repurposing drugs that already exist to treat patients with COVID-19. One such drug, remdesivir, has already been studied rigorously in a Chinese trial sponsored by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Within the United States, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) issued a [press release](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19) on April 29, 2020 touting the success of remdesivir in an American clinical trial. On May 22, 2020, the data from that trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. That study will be covered in a future Resaerch Explained summary.
