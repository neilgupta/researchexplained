title: About
description: We want to empower everyone to understand the latest scientific research without having an advanced degree in the subject. Our team of scientists and designers works collaboratively to create balanced, easy-to-follow summaries and analyses of important scientific research. We also publish ratings of how popular news sites are covering these studies, so you can see how accurate the news coverage has been compared to the information actually written in the research paper.
question: What is Research Explained?
---

<p>
  As a team, we are committed to doing our very best to review each research study and news article with an open mind, but we recognize that science and communication are inherently human endeavors. There are times where we might fall short, be proven wrong, or our understanding will change as new information comes to light. We welcome any feedback or criticism, and where necessary, we will addend or edit our reviews.
