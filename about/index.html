title: About
description: We want to empower everyone to understand the latest scientific research without having an advanced degree in the subject. Our team of scientists and designers works collaboratively to create balanced, easy-to-follow summaries and analyses of important scientific research. We also publish qualitative ratings of popular news sites’ coverage of these articles so readers can see how accurate the news coverage has been compared to the information actually written in the research paper.
question: What is Research Explained?
---

<p>
  As a team, we are committed to doing our very best to review each research study and news article with an open mind, but we recognize that science and communication are inherently human endeavors. There are times where we might fall short, be proven wrong, or our understanding will change as new information comes to light. We welcome any feedback or criticism, and where necessary, we will addend or edit our reviews. Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@researchexplained.org" title="Say hello!">contact@researchexplained.org</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/researchexplain" title="Follow us on Twitter">@researchexplain</a>

        Farzad received his bachelor’s of science degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biology from MIT, and completed his PhD work at USC on molecular evolution of diagnostic and therapeutic peptides via mRNA display. He has worked for two startup companies, working on sensitive and specific detection of disease biomarkers (after his undergraduate degree), and developing peptide therapeutics (after his PhD). He is currently a postdoctoral fellow in structural biology at Oregon Health and Science University, working to unravel the molecular mechanism of NMDA receptor modulation by Cryoelectron microscopy.
