## Key takeaways

* In a well-designed, gold standard study, patients who received remdesivir recovered an average of four days sooner than patients who did not receive remdesivir.
* Recovering four days faster may seem like a relatively small benefit at the individual level. However, at the population level, this could be important for health systems which can be quickly overwhelmed if patients have to stay in the hospital for an extended period.
* Remdesivir increased the rate of recovery mainly for patients that did not need a ventilator. For sicker patients, the authors did not find a significant effect of remdesivir.
* The study was stopped earlier because of the promising results, so we don't know whether remdesivir had a statistically significant effect in reducing the number of deaths.

## Why is this important?

There is no confirmed treatment for COVID-19. In addition to creating new treatments (which will take many months to be tested and made widely available), the scientific community has turned to existing medicines in the hunt for treatments. Remdesivir has been widely discussed in general media, especially after being positively mentioned by Dr. Anthony Faucci, one of the principal advisors to President Trump on the coronavirus. This study is an important piece of evidence in the search for a treatment. Research Explained previously covered a [study from China that did not show a beneficial effect to Remdesivir](https://researchexplained.neil.gg/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)31022-9/). Furthermore, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made remdesivir available under an emergency-use authorization for treatment of severe COVID-19. Since patients are already receiving remdesivir, there is greater importance and urgency in disseminating accurate and evidence-based information about its effects to the medical community.
