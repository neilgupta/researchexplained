Research Explained aims to stop the spread of misinformation by empowering the general public to understand the latest scientific research without being a subject matter expert. Our focus is research related to COVID-19.

It is difficult to determine whether a news headline is really supported by the source paper. The study could have faulty methodology or the news source could misrepresent the conclusions drawn by the researchers. While the scientific community relies on peer reviews to promote high quality papers, the general public is not qualified to review every paper, both due to lack of context and time. Instead, they rely on summaries from mainstream media sources, who tend to report on papers before they have passed the necessary peer review process. This creates a gap between when a paper is posted and when it is vetted and accepted by the community.

We fill that gap by creating objective summaries of the quantitative facts presented in a paper, along with a rating of the media's coverage to highlight any deviations. We publish those summaries in a standardized and visual format that is accessible to anyone with a high school education or better.

We are a team of doctors, designers, and engineers working together to create the best summaries.
